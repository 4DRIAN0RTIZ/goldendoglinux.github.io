### Issues, Bug Reports and Technical Help

Technical issues and bug reports: [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/goldendoglinux/support/issues)


### IRC

The official IRC Channel for goldendog can be found on Libera Network. To connect, configure your irc client to **irc.libera.chat** channel **#goldendog**


### Discord

The official discord channel (also bridged to irc) is hosted on my personal discord server. It is invite-only at the moment.

In any case, bear in mind that the conversations might be predominantly in Spanish. Feel free to request help in English, though. Both languages are accepted.



# Contributing to the development of GoldenDog

Right now I am the sole developer and maintainer, feel free to reach out to me over IRC in case you can help me with the development or organize teams. It's a work in progress still.
