### GoldenDog Linux

Hello, I'm Alexia, the founder of GoldenDog. 

I am rebuilding this website all by myself, right now. And well, building websites is really not my thing, but I am sure I will have a lot of fun with this!

Please bear with me in the meantime. 


I want to make this a bit more functional and intuitive ahead of the public release of GDL. 


Thank you for understanding. See you soon!
