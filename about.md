### About GoldenDog (...And its author)

![Image](assets/images/alexia-profile.png){: style="float: left; width: 40%; height: 50%;  margin-right: 20px;"}
Everything began a long time ago, as some kind of joke, I guess. I used to like an old Linux distro called [YellowDog Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Dog_Linux)
But this distro was discontinued a while back.

What made it special was that it was for the **PowerPC** Architectures, so one could install it in an old Mac or a playstation 3, for instance :V

So this is where the "joke" took place:

I said I would revive YellowDog but for the AMD64 Architectures. Of course I never did it.

Building a distro is something definitely easier said than done.
